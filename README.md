# Memory-Matching-Game
Memory Matching Game: <br>A fun and engaging project that demonstrates the use of logic and the development of a user interface. <br><br>
Technology Used: <br>Canva, json, html

1) I created the animal graphics in Canva with a 512 x 512 pixel dimension. The graphics were then downloaded from Canva as a png file and uploaded to GitHut in the pics directory.
2) I set up the repository so that the index.html file runs in 'Pages'. The index file is in the root of the repo, so in the Pages setting, I set the 'Source' to point to the root folder under the main branch.
3) I created the gamecards.json file which has an entry for each of the animals that will be on the cards for matching.
4) The index.html file links to the CSS stylesheet and to the Javascript file.  The restart() function in the JS file will be called from the body when the 'Restart' button is clicked.
