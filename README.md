# Memory-Matching-Game
Memory Matching Game: <br>A fun and engaging project that demonstrates the use of logic and user interface development. <br><br>
Technology Used: <br>Canva

1) Created the animal graphics in Canva with a 512 x 512 pixel dimension. The graphics were then downloaded from Canva as a png file and uploaded to GitHut in the pics directory.
2) I set up the repository so that the index.html file runs in 'Pages'. The index file is in the root of the repo, so in the Pages setting, I set the 'Source' to point to the root folder under the main branch.
